Hi people, this is my first app using RoR, it's basicaly a task manager tool. Some features are listed next:

- You can add new tasks (things to do, like study, clean the room, do the dishes, etc) 
- Update the tasks when done (select the task you want to mark as done)
- Delete the selected tasks

And it's just this =)
Hope you enjoy and feel free to learn from the code =D
